# Miya-bot

Miya-bot is a lightweight administrative bot that alleviates the strain on simple admin and officer tasks for a Discord Guild.  
Currently Miya-bot is in **alpha**, so she isn't out for public use just yet. This code is to provide transparency and collaboration.  

Miya-bot was originally a small side project, started from the burden of managing a Guild on discord along with special role-specific mentions.

## Installation
As Miya-bot is not currently open to the public, there is no installation guide just yet.

## Disclaimer
Miya-bot is still in alpha, and is in-progress. Users beware.
