# Takane
![Takane](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jopika/Takane/master/Takane.png)

Takane is a lightweight administrative bot that alleviates the strain on simple admin and officer tasks for a Discord Guild.  
Currently Takane is in **alpha**, so she's still considered bleeding edge. This code is to provide transparency and collaboration.  

Takane was originally a small side project, started from the burden of managing a Guild on discord along with special role-specific mentions.

Currently, Takane has a few extra features that are implemented, along with some in the works.
* Granblue Fantasy Stickers - use !stamp [id] and insert the stickers into your conversations!  
* Admin-level management - Allow certain selected users to add/restrict commands and roles, without editing any configs.
